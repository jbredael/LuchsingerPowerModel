# Simulation settings for Luchsinger power model
# These settings define the operational and environmental conditions
# for power curve calculations.

# Operational parameters
operational:
  cut_in_wind_speed_m_s: 4.0      # Cut-in wind speed [m/s]
  cut_out_wind_speed_m_s: 25.0    # Cut-out wind speed [m/s]
  elevation_angle_out_deg: 30.0   # Tether elevation during reel-out [degrees]
  elevation_angle_in_deg: 45.0    # Tether elevation during reel-in [degrees]
  minimum_tether_length_m: 100.0  # Minimum tether length [m]

# Atmosphere parameters
atmosphere:
  air_density_kg_m3: 1.225        # Air density at sea level [kg/m³]
